            The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
            recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
            came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
            decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
            also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
            superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
            business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin II "Oakenshield"</h3>
                <p>
                    Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth,
                    Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in
                    exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA
                    2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his
                    shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield,"
                    which remained with him even in death.

            <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
                <p>
                    Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews of
                    Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
                    the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
                <p>
                    Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the
                    quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would
                    come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing
                    the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five
                    Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the
                    company of Thorin.

            <h3>Glóin</h3>
                <p>
                    In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves
                    and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.
                    <br>            
                    In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA
                    2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so
                    that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also
                    said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".
